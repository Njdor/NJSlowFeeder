# NJSlowFeeder

V1.2 is out and CAD models are stable. See Issues for additional adaptors or to request additional functionality.

Code is very much a proof of concept, and under development.

## Working Functions:
1. Variable speed control (hold up/down once wheel is turning)
2. On/Off control of wheel
3. Loadcell reading and setup taring (basic)
4. Deepsleep (works, but currently buggy with the HX711 for some reason)

## Planned Functions:
- [ ] WebUI for parameter control
- [ ] PoopCode :tm: - Precise single dosing of beans (for filling vials or grinding)


This readme will be updated with more information in the future.
